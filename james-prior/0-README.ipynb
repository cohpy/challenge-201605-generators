    "# The May 2016 COhPy challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge for May is to write a program that uses a generator. It can do\n",
    "anything (some examples you could choose are below). Write tests for your\n",
    "code to make sure it works as you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, as a bonus, recreate the program without using a generator. Use the tests\n",
    "you wrote for the generator version to ensure that your new version works the same.\n",
    "Compare the two and see if a generator is worth-while. Does it make the code\n",
    "easier to understand, more useful, more general, etc.? Write tests for your code\n",
    "to make sure that it works as you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick one to start, and then see if you can do more.\n",

    "    > Cell #3 uses nested try/excepts.\n",
    "    > Cell #5 uses a dictionary of parsing functions.\n",
